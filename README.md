# mtk_imei

This is rewrite of ``MP0B_001`` generator for some MTK based phones. ([MTK6516](https://forum.xda-developers.com/wiki/Chinese_Clones_MTK6516#Backup.2C_Generate_.26_Restore_IMEI)) 

It is rewrite of popular ``imei.c`` in JavaScript and it can be used to restore your real IMEI after breaking baseband (and you would never use it to spoof IMEI of your phone)...
